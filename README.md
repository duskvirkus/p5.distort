# p5.distort

p5.distort is a javascript library that extends the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) project. It's a collection of ES6 javascript classes to make vertex manipulation in shapes and text easier. It doesn't expand the capabilities of p5.js it just streamlines the workflow.


While the library is written in ES6 syntax the minified distribution is compatible with earlier versions of javascript thanks to [babel](https://babeljs.io/).


This is an open source project maintained by Fi Graham and is open to contributions on GitHub. I started this library after creating the structure for it while working on another project and thought others might benefit from that work.

More information and live examples are available on the [project website](https://figraham.github.io/p5.distort).
